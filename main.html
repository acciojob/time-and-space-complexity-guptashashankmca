<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time and space complexity depends on lots of things like hardware, operating system, processors, etc. However, efficient we don't consider any of these factors while analyzing the algorithm. We will only consider the execution time of an algorithm.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute as a function of its input size. One common category is O(n) space complexity, also known as linear space complexity. This means the memory used by the algorithm grows proportionally to the input size.</p>
